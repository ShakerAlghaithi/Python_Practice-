# Instructions

# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 ÷ 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.


# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆


#Write your code below this row 👇
heights_Sum=0  #getting the sum of students heights
for heights in student_heights:
    heights_Sum += heights

# calculating how many elements in the list:
num_of_elements=0
for element in student_heights:
    num_of_elements +=1
#calculating the heights avrage:
avrage = round(heights_Sum / num_of_elements)

print (avrage)
